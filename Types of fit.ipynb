good fit model, you need to look at the peformance of machine learning model over time with the training data. as the algorithm learns overtime, the error for the model on the training data reduces, as well as the error on the test dataset. if you train the model for too long, the model may learn the unnecessary details and the noise in the training set and ence lead to overfitting. in order to achieve a good fit, you need to stop training at a point where the error starts to increase.\n","\n","BIAS:\n","\n","it is a prediction error that is introduced in the model due to oversimplifying machine learning algorithms. or it is the difference between the predicted values and actual values.\n","\n","Variance:\n","\n","if the machine learning model performs well with the training dataset,
